-add configure
-remove dependence on libjpeg - replace with ffmpeg


06/12/2009
Add configure with dependencies:
X11 include files (development)
libjpeg include files (development)
ffmpeg


03/06/09
*save project
	fti and freethought library separate projects? (no, lib .a .so? automade, ln made)
*generate makefile
*build .exe
*AddWindow_name - need to have OpenWindow("name") function (like CloseWindow); 
	Windows added automatically at program initialization - 
	perhaps window creating function: Window_main() 
	How does init know all window "add" function addresses?
		get from a project file? (but makes project file required)
		makefile generates file with function that puts list of windows create addresses in PStatus
	Currently AddWindow_... DrawWindow("") DrawWindow could be OpenWindow - and windows added initially as AddWindow=(func)(*individualfuncname)?
+Combo controls: make windows autogenerated in freethought? or somehow autocreated - posibly it should not be a window, but simply drawn over the background - I think this was a problem, because it may extend beyond the current window-and we do not want it clipped. Possibly when AddItem - if no SubMenu audo create submenu window, since submenu may have submenu - possibly:
	AddItem(control *menu,int itemnum,char *text);
	AddSubMenu(control *parent,int itemnum,control *submenu);

+port to MacOS
+port to Windows
	use gilbc win32 port?
	development - free 2005?
+tabs
+instructions, example projects
+make scroll bar work for textareas
+add grid control (includes list - for entries like name, number, etc)
	with header buttons that can sort
+doubleclick on textarea does not appear to be calling doubleclick function
+integrate file folder (Location:) dtextbox with fileopen control - add other fileopen buttons? make as bit options CTFO_Location - currently user has to create and update

-Windows have minimum resize size
-port to MacOS
-port to Windows
-different color text in textarea
	make CHTML bit for CTTEXTAREA? add HTML interpretation? <span style="color:rgb(255,255,255);">
	make a simplified <c 0x123456> scheme?
	make a function and add to data? character-instr-opt1  
		what is this called? html, rtf, pdf, doc, ps, etc - called? text/image formating
		settextareacolor()1=0x01,2=0x000000a,3=0xff00ff 1=font color change,2=character 10,3=to font color 0xff00ff
		settextareafont 1=change-2=font name-3=
		0=font color, 1=background color, 2=font name, 3=size, 4=bold, 5=italic, 6=underline, 7=super, 8=sub, 
		unicode/utf8? 16-bit fonts?
	tab - set tabs
-create error-tracing program - inserts potential break in between each command so breakpoint can be set and variables examined. - Store each 1) variable type 2) variable name and 3) address in list, so people can enter the name, and the address contents will then be shown in the variable type format - and possibly add some kind of on-the-fly typecasting too.	- examine gdb

=======================
open combo loses focus of window
checkbox enter key down not select

[selected tabbed highlight with dotted box?]

need to make function to openmenu
-filemenu and submenu different
-problem with mouse open versus key open

need function to determine window locations
-for main menu y is tcontrol->y2 (unless no space, then roowindowy-height
-    x is tcontrol->x1 if possible, if not enough space on right is rootwindow-width of new window
-for sub menu y is twin->y1, or rootwiny-new window height
-    x is twin->x2, or twin->x2-width


other menus click on other window does not set their focus, closes menu

potential error:  submenu window is left and/or above main menu (since absolute screen coords, should not be problem)

maybe easier way to find what submenu mouse is over, than going down control submenus and item submenus

almost like need to store menu window/control in PStatus when gets focus

open mb close main window=seg fault

alt-x exit


-click down on file up off file, no mouse reset, mouse over top of combo, erase subwindow highlight
button down up in combo, do mouseover again


focus out on control after enter, buttondowup select item

make control strings malloc'd

mouseover remove when mouse leaves window/control

arrow keys on filemenu
intercept buttondown

button up on filewmenu window
file menu has xraisewindow and a visible change is seen
button down on filemenu and then up on item doesnt work

on buttondown open window, but setfocus back to parent

button down makes mouse move for window that has the button down, not the window the mouse is over
- for filemenus this causes a problem, since file menu is in different window
-move window closes filemenu

Buttondown on filemenu, does checkcontrolmousemove (motionotify) for main, not mainsmenu window
need to give focus back to submenu


opening menus
-open in main window because can open outside window
-adjust to not be drawn off screen

with large list of files, slider very small

current directory - cannot run fti from different dir, needs images

16 bit bitmap drawing problem on p550

open subwindow/itemlist on left if new window would go beyond main window is

make imain() function call from main()?  - still need to include .h

deal with same name different window controls, 
-1) getcontrol(win,...)

error on resize when slider on bottom i[1]= extras on itemlist listed
during resize on fileopen, wait for resize to stop 

select more than 1 item in fileopen, need to make list of selected items

only redraw scroll button if changed location

move all scroll control logic into freethought.c
CScrollUp,CScrollDown,CScrollLeft,CScrollRight,CScrollVButton,CScrollHButton,CScrollVBack,CScrollHBack;
item=fileopen,combo control linked to this scroll bar control

move Name,Size, Date into freethought.c?
CFOName,CFOSize,CFODate
item has name of name,size,date controls
item=fileopen linked to this title control

text -center text, right text

Button Tags

LoadJPEG() for control image
image array
Radio->Option
Combo->DropDown
change tcontrol->flags to tcontrol->Bits (twin->Bits, PStatus->Bits)

automatically give z values to filemenus (-1,-2,-3...as they open)

figure out how to have a window with no titlebar
figure out why createsimplewindow does not set position of window, remove movewindow in addwindow
open submenu to left if no space on right


make freethought.c not have to include ft_human.c main file
1-Move main() to ft_human main window .c file

scale buttons in a window that gets resized (text and images...) equally (not simply grow, or make a relative grow)


GetControl(NOWARNING) - no warning for get control 


loadjpgtocontrol,win - 32 bits is screen resolution? try on different computers


resize expose problem -0 fileopen

instead of growx1,growy1, ... CScale (Scale control at resize), other controls do not scale on resize
actually some controls like scroll bar buttons do not scale but simply move
maybe a CScaleMove - move the control by scalex/scaley
for example 2x scale
scaled control is 0,0 10,10 is at 0,0,20,20  CScaleResize
control at 10,0 20,10 is now at 20,20,30,30  CScaleMove

figure out if ButtonDownUpOnControl[button] is needed

resize must make sure fileopen index is ok, extra files listed, simple redraw should work?, numvisible has to change


videoedit
--------------------------
save/load project file (store each track control)

play wave to speaker in real time

fix cursor draw/erase in text box
place cursor with mouse in textbox
textbox is selected tab when window gets focus again
fix problem with delete track data control
cut track in two

connect mark in+out with colored line



buttons make 3d, press effect
move text to middle of button
file menu
in/out avi
vertical scroll bar


make making and placing controls and windows drawn with mouse (VB)
clean up special keys code (big switch)
in/out mp3
scroll with drag mark in/out

make vertical scroll bar work


Work with samples from disk (do not load)


add video
-mjpeg
-mpg-2
